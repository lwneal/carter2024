        <p style="padding:32px; width: 80%;">President Carter is <b>constitutionally eligible to run</b> in 2024. He is <b>more capable</b> and <b>more prepared</b> than <b>any other</b> former president to lead our nation in the 20's.</p>

        <p>Jimmy Carter is a strong advocate for human rights and social justice. He has dedicated his life to promoting peace and equality, both at home and abroad. From his work to improve living conditions for rural Americans as a young man, to his ongoing efforts to build homes for those in need through Habitat for Humanity, Jimmy Carter's commitment to helping others is unwavering. As President, he will continue to fight for the rights of marginalized communities, and to create a more equitable society for all Americans.</p>

    <div class="main-content">
        <p>In addition to his humanitarian efforts, Jimmy Carter is also a leader in sustainable energy and environmental conservation. He understands the critical importance of protecting our planet for future generations, and has a proven track record of taking bold action to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and promote renewable energy sources. From his decision to install solar panels on the White House in the 1970s, to his ongoing work to promote clean energy through the Carter Center, Jimmy Carter has shown time and again that he is committed to building a sustainable future for America.</p>

        <p>Jimmy Carter's foreign policy was marked by a commitment to diplomacy and the peaceful resolution of conflicts. He played a key role in the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, and worked tirelessly to broker a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt. He also encouraged respect for human rights in foreign policy.
        Jimmy Carter's achievements in foreign policy demonstrate his ability to balance diplomacy with firmness in the face of aggression.</p>
